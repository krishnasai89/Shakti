    The Dasa Mahavidya (Ten Great Wisdom Goddesses) are ten forms of the Divine Mother, 
    symbolizing different aspects of cosmic power and spiritual wisdom. They guide devotees 
    toward liberation, protection, and transformation.
    The Dasa Mahavidya story describes how Goddess Sati, in a fit of anger and to prove her 
    divine status to her husband Shiva, manifests as ten terrifying forms (the Dasa Mahavidyas) 
    to prevent Shiva from leaving after he forbids her from attending her father Daksha's sacrificial ceremony. 
    Sati feels Shiva is treating her as an ordinary woman and not the Mother of the Universe, leading her to 
    demonstrate her true, supreme power by creating these ten forms, one for each direction, thus blocking Shiva's 
    escape and making him aware of her infinite, divine might.
